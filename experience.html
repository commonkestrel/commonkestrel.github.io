                <p>
                    I am currently interning at the BOND Management Department for my local school district.
                    I have picked up a variety of skills and knowledge from the staff I have worked with, 
                    in diciplines such as Construction Management, Project Management, and Finance.
                    Most of my work has been in data collection and input, through tasks such as taking
                    photos around the construction site to log progress and entering RFIs into documents.
                    I have also with contracts and financials through the collection of insurance contracts from contractors.

                <h2>Library Internship</h2>
                <img class="portrait" src="/static/library.jpg" />
                <p>
                    I have actually interned at my local library two seperate times,
                    once as a Display Intern and another time as a Lunch with the Library Intern.
                    I picked up a multitude of skills from these positions,
                    with each internship consisting of a large variety of tasks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During my time as a Display Intern, I used graphic design programs such as Canva
                    to create a multitude of social media posts and physical displays for the library.
                    I also worked with the large library database, adding, removing, and editing book entries.
                    While it wasn't a part of my official duties, I ended up creating a number of helpful scripts and extensions
                    for the library, such as programs to search our database for author images and scrape the Lexile and AR levels for books from online,
                    as well as an extension deployed on all of the customer-facing devices
                    designed to automatically redirect to the homepage after a period of inactivity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During my time as a Lunch with the Library Intern, I learned a variety of customer service and food preperation skills.
                    I prepared and handled food for children, leading me to earn my Food Handler's license.
                    I also learned how to interact with children and their parents through serving free lunch to children.
